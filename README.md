# HANA Work
Things I've worked on and learned about at Hana during my summer internship there.
Main project is to create a survey template (along the lines of google forms) so that staff in HR can create surveys about employee satisfaction in various areas and then get other members of staff to fill it out and view statistics. I am working on this project with one of the senior systems analyst.
